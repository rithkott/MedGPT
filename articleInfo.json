        "title": "Immune landscape and oncobiota in HPV-Associated Colorectal Cancer: an explorative study.",
        "abstract": "Worldwide more than 550,000 new patients suffering from malignant tumors are associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection. However, only a small portion of patients infected progress to cancer, suggesting that other factors other than HPV may play a role. Some studies have investigated HPV infection in colorectal cancer (CRC) with discordant results; moreover, the role of HPV in CRC development is still unknown. We investigated HPV infection in 50 CRC from different regions, excluding the anal one, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time PCR and RNA-seq. For each patient, we studied the tumor microenvironment in neoplastic and matched non-neoplastic samples, and we compared the tumor-infiltrating immune cell phenotypes among HPV-positive and negative samples. Finally, we compared the CRC-associated microbiota in HPV-positive and negative neoplastic samples by 16S rRNA sequencing. HPV infection was identified in 20% of CRC from the right side (caecum, ascending and transverse colon) and in 40% from the left side (descending colon and rectum). In all HPV-positive CRCs we found no expression of p53 and RB, thus suggesting HPV involvement in tumorigenesis. As far as the tumor microenvironment is concerned, in HPV-related cancers we observed a neoplastic environment with a reduced immune surveillance but an enhanced cytotoxic response by lymphocytes. HPV-positive and -negative CRC showed a different microbiota with lack of species normally found in CRC in the HPV-positive ones. Our results support the carcinogenic significance of HPV in CRC, suggesting a role of HPV in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment.",

        "title": "Chlorogenic Acid Derivatives: Structural Modifications, Drug Design, and Biological Activities: A Review.",
        "abstract": "Phenolic acids have recently gained considerable attention because of their numerous practical, biological, and pharmacological benefits. Various polyphenolic compounds are widely distributed in plant sources. Flavonoids and phenolic acids are the two main polyphenolic compounds that many plants contain abundant polyphenols. Chlorogenic acid, one of the most abundant phenolic acids, has various biological activities, but it is chemically unstable and degrades into other compounds or different enzymatic processes.\nIn this review, we have studied many publications about CA and its derivatives. CA derivatives were classified into three categories in terms of structure and determined each part's effects on the body. The biological evaluations, structure-activity relationship, and mechanism of action of CA derivatives were investigated. The search databases for this review were ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed and google scholar.\nMany studies have reported that CA derivatives have demonstrated several biological effects, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbes, anti-mutation, anti-carcinogenic, anti-viral, anti-hypercholesterolemia, anti-hypertensive, anti-bacterial, and hypoglycemic actions. The synthesis of new stable CA derivatives can enhance its metabolic stability and biological activity.\nThe present study represented different synthetic methods and biological activities of CA derivatives. These compounds showed high antioxidant activity across a wide range of biological effects. Our goal was to help other researchers design and develop stable analogs of CA for the improvement of its metabolic stability and the promotion of its biological activity.",

        "abstract": "Cr(VI) is a carcinogenic heavy metal that forms an oxygen-containing anion, which is difficult to remove from water by adsorbents. Here, industrial alkali lignin was transformed into a Cr(VI) adsorbent (N-LC) by using a two-step hydrothermal strategy. The characterization results of the adsorbent showed that O and N were uniformly distributed on the surface of the adsorbent, resulting in a favorable morphology and structure. The Cr(VI) adsorption of N-LC was 13.50 times that of alkali lignin, and the maximum was 326.10\u202fmg\u202fg",
