        "abstract": "Following an ischemic injury to the brain, the induction of angiogenesis is critical to neurological recovery. The angiogenic benefits of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been attributed at least in part to the actions of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that they secrete. EVs are membrane-bound vesicles that contain various angiogenic biomolecules capable of eliciting therapeutic responses and are of relevance in cerebral applications due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Though MSCs are commonly cultured under oxygen levels present in injected air, when MSCs are cultured under physiologically relevant oxygen conditions (2-9% O\nHuman adipose-derived MSCs were grown in clinically relevant serum-free medium and exposed to either headspace oxygen concentrations of 18.4% O\nCompared to normoxic conditions, culturing MSCs under physioxic conditions increased their expression of angiogenic genes SDF1 and VEGF, and subsequently elevated VEGF-A content in the EV fraction. MSC-EVs demonstrated an ability to induce CMEC angiogenesis by promoting tube formation, with the EV fraction from physioxic cultures having the greatest effect. The physioxic EV fraction further upregulated the expression of CMEC angiogenic genes FGF2, HIF1, VEGF and TGFB1, as well as genes (OCLN and TJP1) involved in BBB maintenance.\nEVs from physioxic MSC cultures hold promise in the generation of a cell-free therapy to induce angiogenesis.

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is notoriously resistant to current therapies due to tumor heterogeneity. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess infinite self-renewal potential and contribute to the inherent heterogeneity of GC. Despite its crucial role in chemoresistance, the mechanism of stemness maintenance of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) remains largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that lengsin, lens protein with glutamine synthetase domain (LGSN), a vital cell fate determinant, is overexpressed in GCSCs and is highly correlated with malignant progression and poor survival in GC patients. Ectopic overexpression of LGSN in GCSC-derived differentiated cells facilitated their dedifferentiation and treatment resistance by interacting with vimentin and inducing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Notably, genetic interference of LGSN effectively suppressed tumor formation by inhibiting GCSC stemness maintenance and provoking gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis through vimentin degradation/NLRP3 signaling. Depletion of LGSN combined with the chemo-drugs 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin could offer a unique and promising approach to synergistically rendering this deadly cancer eradicable in vivo. Our data place focus on the role of LGSN in GCSC regeneration and emphasize the critical importance of pyroptosis in battling GCSC.",

This review delves into the intricate relationship among aging, infection-induced inflammation, chronic inflammation, and frailty. In addition, it analyzes various approaches and interventions to address frailty, such as smart rehabilitation programs and stem-cell treatments, offering promising solutions in this new era. Given the importance of this topic, further research into the mechanisms of frailty is crucial.

        "abstract": "One of the consistent features in development of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the rapidity with which discoveries in the laboratory are translated into innovations in clinical care. Just a few years after murine studies demonstrated that rescue from radiation induced marrow failure is mediated by cellular not humoral factors, E. Donnall Thomas reported on the transfer of bone marrow cells into irradiated leukemia patients. This was followed quickly by the first descriptions of Graft versus Leukemia (GvL) effect and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Despite the pivotal nature of these findings, early human transplants were uniformly unsuccessful and identified the challenges that continue to thwart transplanters today - leukemic relapse, regimen related toxicity, and GvHD. While originally only an option for young, fit patients with a matched family donor, expansion of the donor pool to include unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and more recently the growing use of haploidentical donors have all made transplant a more accessible therapy for patients with ALL. Novel agents for conditioning, prevention and treatment of GvHD have improved outcomes and investigators continue to develop novel treatment strategies that balance regimen related toxicity with disease control. Our evolving understanding of how to prevent and treat GvHD and how to prevent relapse are incorporated into novel clinical trials that are expected to further improve outcomes. Here we review current considerations and future directions for both adult and pediatric patients undergoing HCT for ALL, including indication for transplant, donor selection, cytoreductive regimens, and outcomes.",

A clinically viable biomaterial that enhances cell retention could optimize intramyocardial cell delivery. In this study, we developed a therapeutic cell delivery method for MI treatment utilizing a photocrosslinkable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel. Human vascular progenitor cells, capable of forming functional vasculatures upon transplantation, were combined with an in-situ photopolymerization approach and injected into the infarcted zones of mouse hearts. Our strategy substantially improved acute cell retention and promoted long-term post-MI cardiac healing, including stabilized cardiac functions, preserved viable myocardium, and reduced cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, engrafted vascular cells polarized recruited bone marrow-derived neutrophils toward a non-inflammatory phenotype via TGF\u03b2 signaling, fostering a pro-regenerative microenvironment. Neutrophil depletion negated the therapeutic benefits generated by cell delivery in ischemic hearts, highlighting the essential role of non-inflammatory, pro-regenerative neutrophils in cardiac remodeling.

        "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of all severities is a significant public health burden, causing a range of effects that can lead to death or a diminished quality of life. Liposomes and mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes are two drug delivery agents with potential to be leveraged in the treatment of TBI by increasing the efficacy of drug therapies as well as having additional therapeutic effects. They exhibit several physical similarities, but key differences affect their performances as nanocarriers. Liposomes can be produced commercially at scale, and liposomes achieve higher encapsulation efficiency. Meanwhile, the intrinsic cargo and targeting moieties of exosomes, which liposomes lack, give exosomes a greater ability to facilitate neural regeneration, and exosomes do not trigger the infusion reactions that liposomes can. However, there are concerns about both exosomes and liposomes regarding interactions with tumors. The same routes of administration can be used for both exosomes and liposomes, resulting in somewhat different distribution throughout the body. While the effect of the nanocarrier type on accumulation in the brain is not concrete, targeting leads to increased accumulation of both exosomes and liposomes in the brain, upon which on-demand release can be used for both drug deliverers. Although neither have been applied to TBI in humans, preclinical trials have shown their immense potential, as have clinical trials pertaining to other brain injuries and conditions. While questions remain, research thus far shows that the various differences make exosomes a better choice of nanocarrier for TBI.",

Our previous work suggests that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and MSCs overexpressing alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT-MSCs) could be therapeutic tools for CP treatment in mouse models. However, primary MSCs have a predisposition to undergo senescence during culture expansion which limits their therapeutic applications. Here we generated and characterized immortalized human MSCs (iMSCs) and AAT-MSCs (iAAT-MSCs) and tested their protective effect on 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced acinar cell death in an in vitro cell culture system. Primary MSCs were immortalized by transduction with simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LT), and the resulting iMSC and iAAT-MSC lines were analyzed for proliferation, senescence, phenotype, and multi-differentiation potential. Subsequently, the impact of these cells on TNBS-induced cell death was measured and compared. Both apoptosis and ferroptosis pathways were investigated by assessing changes of critical factors before and after cell treatment. Coculture of iMSCs and iAAT-MSCs with acinar cell lines inhibited early apoptosis induced by TNBS, reduced ER stress, and reversed TNBS-induced protein reduction at tight junctions. Additionally, iMSCs and iAAT-MSCs exerted such protection by regulating mitochondrial respiration, ATP content, and ROS production in TNBS-induced acinar cells. Furthermore, iMSCs and iAAT-MSCs ameliorated ferroptosis by regulating the ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1)/protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)/glutathione peroxide 4 (GPX4) signaling pathways and by modulating ROS function and iron generation in acinar cells. These findings identified ferroptosis as one of the mechanisms that leads to TNBS-induced cell death and offer mechanistic insights relevant to using stem cell therapy for the treatment of CP.",

In this study we investigated metabolic and redox changes occurring during in vitro human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) osteoblastic\u00a0(OB) differentiation and tested on them the impact of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling.\nhDPSCs were isolated from dental pulp and subjected to alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red staining, q-RT-PCR, and western blotting analysis of differentiation markers to assess achievement of osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation. Moreover, a combination of metabolic flux analysis and confocal cyto-imaging was used to profile the metabolic phenotype and to evaluate the redox tone of hDPSCs.\nIn differentiating hDPSCs we observed the down-regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes expression since the early phase of the process, confirmed by metabolic flux analysis, and a reduction of the basal intracellular peroxide level in its later phase.

However, the development of colonic organoids (i.e., colonoids) is particularly challenging due to a lack of simple, cost-effective protocols for colonoid cultivation. Here, intestinal homogenates are described as a supplement to the culture medium for maintaining and replicating colonic stem cells. Colonoids generated by this cultivation protocol demonstrate substantial proliferation and differentiation (3 months). There is a similarity between cultured colonoids and primary colon tissue regarding structure and functionality. To evaluate the functionality of colonoids, permeability testing is performed with suspensions of 4 and 40\u00a0kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-DEX). It is observed that neither can permeate the healthy epithelial barrier. The P-glycoprotein receptor, a vital drug efflux pump mitigating potential drug toxicity, is functionally manipulated, as evidenced by its inhibition function by verapamil and monitoring uptake of Rhodamin 123. In addition, Forskolin treatment which affects chloride transport results in organoid swelling; this confirms the functional expression of the CFTR transporter in the colonoids.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) and analyzed their unique role in regulating the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. We established a passive ITP mouse model and showed that there was a significant M1/M2 imbalance in ITP model mice by assessing the M1/M2 ratios in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow; we observed excessive activation of M1 cells and decreased M2 cell numbers in vivo. We have shown that systemic infusion of hBMSCs effectively elevated platelet levels after disease onset. Further analysis revealed that hBMSCs treatment significantly suppressed the number of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and enhanced the number of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages; additionally, the levels of proinflammatory factors, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, were significantly decreased in vivo, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 were increased. In conclusion, our data suggest that hBMSCs treatment can effectively increase platelet counts, and the mechanism is related to the induction of macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and the decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production, which together ameliorate innate immune disorders.",

A third vaccine elicited significantly increased frequencies of spike-specific non-naive T cells. A small subset of B cell-depleted individuals effectively produced spike-specific antibodies, and logistic regression models identified time since last anti-CD20 treatment and lower cumulative exposure to anti-CD20 mAbs as predictors of those having a serologic response.

From June 2022 to October 2022, 27 patients undergoing orthodontic treatment in our hospital were selected as the research population, with 31 teeth extracted in total. PDLSCs were isolated from PDLs by tissue block culture, and the results were analyzed. Then PDLSCs were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, and changes in METTL3 and m6A levels during differentiation were observed. Additionally, abnormal METTL3 expression vectors were constructed and transfected into PDLSCs to observe the influence of METTL3 on the biological behavior and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. PDLSCs isolated from ex-vivo PDLs were predominantly spindle-shaped, with high CD73, CD90 and CD105 levels and low CD11b, CD34 and CD45 levels, showing the characteristics of stem cells. Spearman correlation coefficients identified a positive connection between Runx2, Sp7, Alp, Bglap, METTL3 and m6A levels and osteogenic differentiation incubation time (P<0.05). As METTL3 expression was increased, the proliferation capacity and osteogenic differentiation ability of PDLSCs were enhanced (P<0.05), and the content of m6A was increased (P<0.05). However, the activity and osteogenic differentiation ability of PDLSCs was decreased after silencing METTL3 (P<0.05).

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete a diversity of factors with broad therapeutic potential, yet current culture methods limit potency outcomes. In this study, we used topographical cues on polystyrene films to investigate their impact on the secretory profile and potency of bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs). hBM-MSCs from four donors were cultured on topographic substrates depicting defined roughness, curvature, grooves and various levels of wettability.\nThe topographical PS-based array was developed using razor printing, polishing and plasma treatment methods. hBM-MSCs from four donors were purchased from RoosterBio and used in co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Cell Applications Inc. in an immunopotency assay to measure immunosuppressive capacity. Cells were cultured on low serum (2%) for 24-48\u00a0h prior to analysis. Image-based analysis was used for cell quantification and morphology assessment. Metabolic activity of BM-hMSCs was measured as the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate using an extracellular flux analyzer. Conditioned media samples of BM-hMSCs were used to quantify secreted factors, and the data were analyzed using R statistics. Enriched bioprocesses were identify using the Gene Ontology tool enrichGO from the clusterprofiler. One-way and two-way ANOVAs were carried out to identify significant changes between the conditions. Results were deemed statistically significant for combined P\u2009<\u20090.05 for at least three independent experiments.\nCell viability was not significantly affected in the topographical substrates, and cell elongation was enhanced at least twofold in microgrooves and surfaces with a low contact angle. Increased cell elongation correlated with a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to a glycolytic state which is indicative of a high-energy state. Differential protein expression and gene ontology analyses identified bioprocesses enriched across donors associated with immune modulation and tissue regeneration. The growth of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was suppressed in hBM-MSCs co-cultures, confirming enhanced immunosuppressive potency. YAP/TAZ levels were found to be reduced on these topographies confirming a mechanosensing effect on cells and suggesting a potential role in the immunomodulatory function of hMSCs.\nThis work demonstrates the potential of topographical cues as a culture strategy to improve the secretory capacity and enrich for an immunomodulatory phenotype in hBM-MSCs.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is one of the most promising advances in cancer treatment. It is based on genetically modified T cells to express a CAR, which enables the recognition of the specific tumour antigen of interest. To date, CAR-T cell therapies approved for commercialisation are designed to treat haematological malignancies, showing impressive clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced-stage tumours. However, since they all use the patient\u00b4s own T cells as starting material (i.e. autologous use), they have important limitations, including manufacturing delays, high production costs, difficulties in standardising the preparation process, and production failures due to patient T cell dysfunction. Therefore, many efforts are currently being devoted to contribute to the development of safe and effective therapies for allogeneic use, which should be designed to overcome the most important risks they entail: immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). This systematic review brings together the wide range of different approaches that have been studied to achieve the production of allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of every strategy. The methods were classified in two major categories: those involving extra genetic modifications, in addition to CAR integration, and those relying on the selection of alternative cell sources/subpopulations for allogeneic CAR-T cell production (i.e. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), umbilical cord blood T cells, memory T cells subpopulations, virus-specific T cells and cytokine-induced killer cells). We have observed that, although genetic modification of T cells is the most widely used approach, new approaches combining both methods have emerged. However, more preclinical and clinical research is needed to determine the most appropriate strategy to bring this promising antitumour therapy to the clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most widespread cancers, with a significant global health effect. UV-induced DNA damage in skin cells triggers them to grow and proliferate out of control, resulting in cancer development. Two common types of skin cancer include melanoma skin cancer (MSC) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, and NMSC includes basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and other forms. The incidence of skin cancer is increasing in part owing to a demographic shift toward an aging population, which is more prone to NMSC, imposing a considerable financial strain on public health services. The introduction of immunostimulatory approaches for cancer cell eradication has led to significant improvements in skin cancer treatment. Over the last three decades, monoclonal antibodies have been used as powerful human therapeutics besides scientific tools, and along with the development of monoclonal antibody production and design procedures from chimeric to humanized and then fully human monoclonal antibodies more than 6 monoclonal antibodies have been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) and have been successful in skin cancer treatment.

Recent advances in disease diagnosis, stratification and prognostication have led to a better characterization of different subgroups of ALL. Notwithstanding the significant improvement in the complete remission rate of B-ALL, patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) and relapsed/refractory (R/R) settings suffer from poor outcomes.\nHowever, novel therapies, such as agents targeting tyrosine kinases or the CD20 molecule, combination therapies and improved supportive care, have changed the treatment landscape of B-ALL.\nMeanwhile, blinatumomab has been FDA-approved for MRD-positive or R/R B-ALL patients. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T cell engager containing the CD3 and CD19 that recognize domains redirecting cytotoxic T cells to lyse B cells.

        "abstract": "Integrin \u03b1v (ITGAV, CD51) is regarded as a key component in multiple stages of tumor progression. However, the clinical failure of cilengitide, a specific inhibitor targeting surface CD51, suggests the importance of yet-unknown mechanisms by which CD51 promotes tumor progression.\nIn this study, we used several hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and murine hepatoma cell lines. To investigate the role of CD51 on HCC progression, we used 3D invasion assay, in vivo bioluminescence imaging, etc. We used periostin-knockout transgenic mice to uncover the role of tumor microenvironment on CD51 cleavage. Moreover, we used several clinical-relevant HCC models, including patient-derived organoids, patient-derived xenografts etc, to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy.\nWe found that CD51 could undergo transmembrane cleavage by \u03b3-secretase to produce a functional intracellular domain (CD51-ICD). The cleaved CD51-ICD facilitated HCC invasion and metastasis by promoting the transcription of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related genes. Furthermore, we identified cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived periostin as the major driver for CD51 cleavage. Lastly, we showed that cilengitide-based therapy displayed a dramatic improvement in both patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and mouse xenograft models when supplemented with the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, LY3039478.\nTo sum up, we revealed previously unrecognized action mechanisms of CD51 on HCC progression and uncovered the underlying cause of cilengitide treatment failure and supported the translational prospects of combined CD51-targeted therapy in the clinic.\nIntegrin \u03b1v (CD51) is a widely recognized pro-tumoral molecule that plays a crucial role in various stages of tumor progression, making it a promising therapeutic target. However, despite early promising results, cilengitide, a specific antagonist of CD51, surprisingly failed in the phase 3 clinical trial. This prompted further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. This study reveals that the \u03b3-secretase complex directly cleaves CD51 to produce an intracellular domain (CD51-ICD), which functions as a pro-tumoral transcriptional regulator and can bypass the inhibitory effects of cilengitide by entering the nucleus. Furthermore, the localization of CD51 in the nucleus is significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. These findings provide a theoretical basis for re-evaluating cilengitide in clinical settings and highlight the importance of identifying a more precise patient subpopulation for future clinical trials targeting CD51.",

        "abstract": "Alendronate (ALN) is a second-generation bisphosphonate widely used for osteoporosis and cancer-induced bone lesions. Many studies have confirmed a strong relationship between osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ) development and oral bisphosphonates, especially ALN, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology have not yet been elucidated. The reduction in bone turnover and vascularization usually observed in ONJ are the result of ALN action on different cell types harboured in oral microenvironment, such as osteoclasts, endothelial cells, and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). In this perspective, the present study aims to investigate the effects of different ALN concentrations (2\u00a0\u03bcM, 5\u00a0\u03bcM, 10\u00a0\u03bcM, 25\u00a0\u03bcM, 50\u00a0\u03bcM) on the phenotype and functional properties of human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs). hPDLSCs showed a decrease in cell viability (MTT assay) only when treated with ALN concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM or larger for 48\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h. Cell cycle analysis revealed a moderate increase in proportion of S-phase cells after exposure to low ALN concentration (2-5\u00a0\u03bcM), an effect that was reverted after exposure to 10-50\u00a0\u03bcM ALN. Conversely, cell death was evidenced via Annexin V/PI assay at very high concentration of ALN (50\u00a0\u03bcM) after 4 days of treatment. In addition, we explored whether the effects of ALN on hPDLSCs growth and survival can be mediated by its ability to modulate oxidative stress. To this, we quantified the intracellular ROS amount and lipid peroxidation by using DCF probe and Bodipy staining, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis showed that ALN induced a dose-dependent reduction of intracellular oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation upon treatment with low concentrations at both 48\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h. Increased levels of oxidative stress was reported at 50\u00a0\u03bcM ALN and was also confirmed via TEM analysis. Despite the stability of the cellular immunophenotype, hPDLSCs showed impaired mobility after ALN exposure. Chronic exposure (7-14 days) to ALN in the range of 2-10\u00a0\u03bcM significantly decreased the expression of the differentiation-related factors ALP, RUNX2, COLI, and OPN as well as the osteogenic ability of hPDLSCs compared with untreated cells. Conversely, higher doses were found to be neutral. Our findings indicated that the effects of ALN on hPDLSCs behavior are dose-dependent and suggest a role for oxidative stress in ALN-induced cell death that may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for ONJ.",

        "abstract": "Short-chain fatty acid butyrate is produced from the bacterial fermentation of indigestible fiber in the intestinal lumen, and it has been shown to attenuate lung inflammation in murine asthma models. Mast cells (MCs) are initiators of inflammatory response to allergens, and they play an important role in asthma. MC survival and proliferation is regulated by its growth factor stem cell factor (SCF), which acts through the receptor, KIT. It has previously been shown that butyrate attenuates the activation of MCs by allergen stimulation. However, how butyrate mechanistically influences SCF signalling to impact MC function remains unknown. Here, we report that butyrate treatment triggered the modification of MC histones via butyrylation and acetylation, and inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Further, butyrate treatment caused downregulation of SCF receptor KIT and associated phosphorylation, leading to significant attenuation of SCF-mediated MC proliferation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Mechanistically, butyrate inhibited MC function by suppressing KIT and downstream p38 and Erk phosphorylation, and it mediated these effects via modification of histones, acting as an HDAC inhibitor and not via its traditional GPR41 (FFAR3) or GPR43 (FFAR2) butyrate receptors. In agreement, the pharmacological inhibition of Class I HDAC (HDAC1/3) mirrored butyrate's effects, suggesting that butyrate impacts MC function by HDAC1/3 inhibition. Taken together, butyrate epigenetically modifies histones and downregulates the SCF/KIT/p38/Erk signalling axis, leading to the attenuation of MC function, validating its ability to suppress MC-mediated inflammation. Therefore, butyrate supplementations could offer a potential treatment strategy for allergy and asthma via epigenetic alterations in MCs.",

Hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R)-exposed SH-SY5Y cells and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-treated rats were served as in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke.

        "abstract": "The potential of urine-derived stem cells (USCs) for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has attracted much attention during the last few decades. However, it has been suggested that the effects of the USCs may be endowed by their paracrine extracellular vesicles (EVs) rather than their differentiation. Compared with the USCs, the USC-EVs can cross the barriers more easily and safely, and their inclusions may mediate intercellular communication and promote the tissue repair. This article has summarized the current knowledge and applications about the USC-EVs in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and discussed the prospects and challenges for using them as an alternative to cell therapy.",

        "abstract": "Targeting tubulin polymerization and depolymerization represents a promising approach to treat solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of a structurally novel tubulin inhibitor, [4-(4-aminophenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl](3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone (ARDAP), in two- and three-dimensional MCF-7 breast cancer models. At sub-cytotoxic concentrations, ARDAP showed a marked decrease in cell proliferation, colony formation, and ATP intracellular content in MCF-7 cells, by acting through a cytostatic mechanism. Additionally, drug exposure caused blockage of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In 3D cell culture, ARDAP negatively affected tumor spheroid growth, with inhibition of spheroid formation and reduction of ATP concentration levels. Notably, ARDAP exposure promoted the differentiation of MCF-7 cells by inducing: (i) expression decrease of Oct4 and Sox2 stemness markers, both in 2D and 3D models, and (ii) downregulation of the stem cell surface marker CD133 in 2D cell cultures. Interestingly, treated MCF7 cells displayed a major sensitivity to cytotoxic effects of the conventional chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In addition, although exhibiting growth inhibitory effects against breast cancer cells, ARDAP showed insignificant harm to MCF10A healthy cells. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of ARDAP to emerge as a new chemotherapeutic agent or adjuvant compound in chemotherapeutic treatments.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal muscle atrophy is a progressive chronic disease associated with various conditions, such as aging, cancer, and muscular dystrophy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is highly correlated with or plays a crucial role in inducing skeletal muscle atrophy. Extracellular vehicles (EVs), including exosomes, mediate cell-cell communication, and alterations in the genetic material contained in EVs during muscle atrophy may impair muscle cell signaling. Transplantation of muscle progenitor cell-derived EVs (MPC-EVs) is a promising approach for treating muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Moreover, stem cell-derived EVs with modification of microRNAs (e.g., miR-26 and miR-29) have been reported to attenuate muscle atrophy. Unbiased RNA-Seq analysis suggests that MPC-EVs may exert an inhibitory effect on IL-6 pathway. Here, we review the latest advances concerning the mechanisms of stem cell/progenitor cell-derived EVs in alleviating muscle atrophy, including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. We also discuss the clinical application of EVs in the treatment of muscle atrophy.",

        "abstract": "With the increasingly prominent problem of population aging, osteoarthritis (OA), which is closely related to aging, has become a serious illness affecting the lives and health of elderly individuals. However, effective treatments are still lacking. OA is typically considered a low-grade inflammatory state. The inflammatory infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, and other cells is common in diseased joints. These cells create the inflammatory environment of OA and are involved in the onset and progression of the disease. Exosomes, a type of complex vesicle containing abundant RNA molecules and proteins, play a crucial role in the physiological and pathological processes of an organism. In comparison to other therapeutic methods such as stem cells, exosomes have distinct advantages of precise targeting and low immunogenicity. Moreover, research and techniques related to exosomes are more mature, indicating a promising future in disease treatment. Many studies have shown that the impact of exosomes on the inflammatory microenvironment directly or indirectly leads to the occurrence of various diseases. Furthermore, exosomes can be helpful in the management of illnesses. This article provides a comprehensive review and update on the research of exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle, in the treatment of OA by modulating the inflammatory microenvironment. It also combines innovative studies on the modification of exosomes. In general, the application of exosomes in the treatment of OA has been validated, and the introduction of modified exosome technology holds potential for enhancing its therapeutic efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Cancer patients had limited treatment options for decades, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, alone or combined. However, there have been substantial improvements in recent years with the introduction of stem cell therapy, hormone therapy, anti-angiogenic treatments, immunotherapy, dendritic cell-based targeted therapy, ablation therapy, nanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy, is a cancer treatment that employs high doses of radiation to eliminate cancer cells and shrink tumors. This treatment is effective as a primary, adjuvant, or palliative therapy. It is an essential, efficient, cost-effective intervention crucial for providing proper palliative oncology care. Although cancer treatment modalities such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy have advanced, they still risk harming the skin and surrounding healthy tissue. Radiotherapy may induce clinical toxicity leading to chronic or acute radiation dermatitis, depending on the toxicity caused by the therapy. Radiation dermatitis, whether in its chronic or acute form, can cause skin shedding that may result in the formation of wounds. Such shedding can also lead to non-healing ulcers and radionecrosis. Mepitel\u00ae film helps control radiation-induced moist desquamation in cancer patients. Clinical trials on the prophylactic use of Mepitel film on radiation-induced moist desquamation did not show similarities among patients from various countries; however, the film-based method is more beneficial than other methods. This review examines the various types of dressings utilized in managing radiation-induced dermatitis to enhance wound healing effectiveness while avoiding harm to newly developing tissues. Additionally, this review compares the effectiveness of using Mepitel film for treating radiation-induced moist desquamation to other methods.",

Anemia in MF is associated with reduced survival and -in primary MF- also with an increased probability of BP. Conventional treatments for anemia have limited effectiveness in MF. Within a dataset of 1752 MF subjects largely unexposed to ruxolitinib (RUX), BP incidence was 2.5% patients per year (p-y). This rate reached respectively 4.3% and 4.5% p-y in case of patients with common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3/4 and grade 2 anemia, respectively, that represented together 32% of the cohort. Among 273 MF cases treated with RUX, BP incidence was 2.89% p-y and it reached 4.86% p-y in subjects who started RUX with CTCAE grade 2 anemia (one third of total). Within patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependency at 6 months of RUX (21% of the exposed), BP rate was 4.2% p-y. Our study highlights a relevant incidence of BP in anemic MF patients, with a similar rate whether treated with or without RUX.

        "abstract": "Glaucoma, an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the corresponding loss of visual fields. This disease is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, making early diagnosis and effective treatment paramount. The pathophysiology of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of the disease, remains poorly understood. Current available treatments, which target elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), are not effective at slowing disease progression in approximately 30% of patients. There is a great need to identify and study treatment options that target other disease mechanisms and aid in neuroprotection for POAG. Increasingly, the role of mitochondrial injury in the development of POAG has become an emphasized area of research interest. Disruption in the function of mitochondria has been linked to problems with neurodevelopment and systemic diseases. Recent studies have shown an association between RGC death and damage to the cells' mitochondria. In particular, oxidative stress and disrupted oxidative phosphorylation dynamics have been linked to increased susceptibility of RGC mitochondria to secondary mechanical injury. Several mitochondria-targeted treatments for POAG have been suggested, including physical exercise, diet and nutrition, antioxidant supplementation, stem cell therapy, hypoxia exposure, gene therapy, mitochondrial transplantation, and light therapy. Studies have shown that mitochondrial therapeutics may have the potential to slow the progression of POAG by protecting against mitochondrial decline associated with age, genetic susceptibility, and other pathology. Further, these therapeutics may potentially target already present neuronal damage and symptom manifestations. In this review, the authors outline potential mitochondria-targeted treatment strategies and discuss their utility for use in POAG.",

In addition, functional hydrogels can respond to changes in temperature, light, magnetic fields, pH, and reactive oxygen species to release drugs, enabling precise treatment. Furthermore, hydrogels can deliver various cargos that promote healing, including nucleic acids, cytokines, small-molecule drugs, stem cells, exosomes, and nanomaterials.

Current management of CVD includes risk factor modification and preventative strategies including dietary and lifestyle changes, smoking cessation, medical management of hypertension and cholesterol lipid levels, and even surgical revascularization procedures if needed. Although these strategies have shown therapeutic efficacy in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, symptoms of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), and major limb amputation significant compliance by patients and caregivers is required and off-target effects from systemic medications can still result in organ dysfunction. Stem cell therapy holds major potential for CVD applications but is limited by the low quantities of cells that are able to traffic to and engraft at diseased tissue sites. New preclinical investigations have been undertaken to modify mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to achieve targeted cell delivery after systemic administration. Although previous reviews have focused broadly on the modification of MSCs for numerous local or intracoronary administration strategies, here we review recent preclinical advances related to overcoming challenges imposed by the high velocity and dynamic flow of the circulatory system to specifically deliver MSCs to ischemic cardiac and peripheral tissue sites. Many of these technologies can also be applied for the targeted delivery of other types of therapeutic cells for treating various diseases.",

SARS-CoV-2 has high infectivity, the ability to be transmitted even during the asymptomatic phase, and relatively low virulence, which has resulted in rapid transmission. SARS-CoV-2 can invade epithelial cells, hence, many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suffered from vascular diseases (VDs) in addition to pulmonary manifestations. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 may can worsen the clinical condition of the patients with pre-existing VDs. Endothelial cells express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a biological enzyme that converts angiotensin (Ang)-\u00a02 to Ang-(1-7). SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor for viral entry. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus promotes downregulation of ACE2, Ang-(1-7), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as, an increase in Ang-2, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause hypertension, and endothelial damage, which can lead to intravascular thrombosis. In this review, we have concentrated on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in peripheral vascular diseases (PVDs) and ACE2 as an enzyme in Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, using related keywords. Articles focusing on (\"SARS-CoV-2\", OR \"COVID-19\"), AND (\"Vascular disease\", OR \"Peripheral vascular disease\", OR interested disease name) with regard to MeSH terms, were selected. According to the studies, it is supposed that vascular diseases may increase susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increased thrombotic burden and endothelial dysfunction. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism and vascular system pathogenesis is crucial for effective management and treatment in pre-existing vascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "Neurogenesis is a process of generating neural stem cells (NSCs) as functional neurons can be decreased after chemotherapy treatments. Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate antagonist that is used for cancer treatment but has negative effects, including oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis and cognitive impairments. Hesperidin (Hsd), a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, has antioxidant and neuroprotection properties. This study investigated whether Hsd could attenuate impairments of hippocampal neural stem cells related to apoptosis induced by MTX. Spraque-Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a024) were divided into 4 groups: (1) Vehicle group received propylene glycol (21 days) and 0.9% normal saline (day 8 and 15), (2) Hsd group received 100\u00a0mg/kg (21 days), (3) MTX group received 75\u00a0mg/kg (days 8 and 15) and (4) MTX+Hsd group received MTX, 75\u00a0mg/kg (day 8 and 15) and Hsd 100\u00a0mg/kg (21 days). Our results showed that MTX decreased hippocampal neural stem cells including SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) and nestin. MTX diminished vascular related (VR) Ki-67 positive cells in the hippocampus but not non-vascular related (NVR) Ki-67. Additionally, MTX reduced SOX2, nestin, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and B-cell lymphoma-2 family of proteins (Bcl-2), whereas Bax and caspase-3 were enhanced in the hippocampal tissues. Interestingly, co-treatment with Hsd and MTX revealed upregulation of SOX2, nestin and VR Ki-67 positive cells as well as elevated SOX2, nestin, PSD-95 and Bcl-2 proteins. Moreover, receiving both Hsd and MTX significantly suppressed increased Bax and caspase-3. These results confirm that Hsd can ameliorate MTX-induced impairments of hippocampal NSC proliferation and neuronal apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Substantial background level of replication stress is a feature of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can predispose to numerical and structural chromosomal instability, including recurrent aberrations of chromosome 12. In differentiated cells, replication stress-sensitive genomic regions, including common fragile sites, are widely mapped through mitotic chromosome break induction by mild aphidicolin treatment, an inhibitor of replicative polymerases. IPSCs exhibit lower apoptotic threshold and higher repair capacity hindering fragile site mapping. Caffeine potentiates genotoxic effects and abrogates G2/M checkpoint delay induced by chemical and physical mutagens. Using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) for replication labeling, we characterized the mitotic entry dynamics of asynchronous iPSCs exposed to aphidicolin and/or caffeine. Under the adjusted timing of replication stress exposure accounting revealed cell cycle delay, higher metaphase chromosome breakage rate was observed in iPSCs compared to primary lymphocytes. Using differential chromosome staining and subsequent locus-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization, we mapped the FRA12L fragile site spanning the large neuronal ANKS1B gene at 12q23.1, which may contribute to recurrent chromosome 12 missegregation and rearrangements in iPSCs. Publicly available data on the ANKS1B genetic alterations and their possible functional impact are reviewed. Our study provides the first evidence of common fragile site induction in iPSCs and reveals potential somatic instability of a clinically relevant gene during early human development and in vitro cell expansion.",

Mitochondria are crucial in maintaining hepatocyte integrity and function. Mitochondrial dysfunction, such as impaired synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes, and altered mitochondrial dynamics, is observed in most liver diseases. Accumulating evidence has substantiated that the therapeutic potential of MSCs is mediated not only through their cell replacement and paracrine effects but also through their regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction in liver disease. Here, we comprehensively review the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of liver disease and how MSCs can target mitochondrial dysfunction. We also discuss recent advances in a novel method that modifies MSCs to enhance their functions in liver disease. A full understanding of MSC restoration of mitochondrial function and the underlying mechanisms will provide innovative strategies for clinical applications. Video Abstract.",

Therefore, we compared the outcomes with a reduced PT-Cy total dose (70\u2009mg/kg) to those with the standard PT-Cy dose (100\u2009mg/kg) in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients aged \u2265\u00a065 years and those with cardiac comorbidities. All consecutive patients with a hematological malignancy receiving peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after a thiotepa-based conditioning with low-dose antithymocyte globulin were included. Thirty-three patients received PT-Cy at 70\u2009mg/kg and 25 at 100\u2009mg/kg. PT-Cy dose reduction did not increase the risk of GVHD and was associated with faster neutrophil and platelet recovery, and lower cumulative incidences of bacteremia (38% versus 72%, p\u2009=\u20090.004) and cardiac complications (12% versus 44%, p\u2009=\u20090.028). At 2 years, GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) was higher with the reduced dose compared to the standard dose (60% versus 33%, p\u2009=\u20090.04). In conclusion, reducing PT-Cy total dose to 70\u2009mg/kg is a safe and valid approach for elderly patients and those with cardiac comorbidities underdoing haploidentical HCT with PBSCs and low-dose antithymocyte globulin. The reduced PT-Cy dose was associated with improved hematological count recovery, lower incidence of toxicities, and higher GRFS.",

        "abstract": "The past decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway in various biological events. HH signaling pathway exerts its biological effects through a complex signaling cascade involved with primary cilium. HH signaling pathway has important functions in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. It plays a central role in the regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells. Importantly, it has become increasingly clear that HH signaling pathway is associated with increased cancer prevalence, malignant progression, poor prognosis and even increased mortality. Understanding the integrative nature of HH signaling pathway has opened up the potential for new therapeutic targets for cancer. A variety of drugs have been developed, including small molecule inhibitors, natural compounds, and long non-coding RNA (LncRNA), some of which are approved for clinical use. This review outlines recent discoveries of HH signaling in tissue homeostasis and cancer and discusses how these advances are paving the way for the development of new biologically based therapies for cancer. Furthermore, we address status quo and limitations of targeted therapies of HH signaling pathway. Insights from this review will help readers understand the function of HH signaling in homeostasis and cancer, as well as opportunities and challenges of therapeutic targets for cancer.",

Familial HLH type 3 (FHL3) accounts for \u223c30% of all inborn HLH cases worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the UNC13D gene, which result in impaired degranulation of cytotoxic vesicles and hence compromised T and NK cell-mediated killing. Current treatment protocols, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, still show high mortality.\nWe sought to develop and evaluate a curative genome editing strategy in the preclinical FHL3 Jinx mouse model. Jinx mice harbor a cryptic splice donor site (cSD) in Unc13d intron 26 and develop clinical symptoms of human FHL3 upon infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).\nWe employed CRISPR-Cas technology to delete the disease-underlying mutation in HSCs, and transplanted Unc13d-edited stem cells into busulfan-conditioned Jinx recipient mice. Safety studies included extensive genotyping and CAST-Seq based off-target analyses. Cure from HLH predisposition was assessed by LCMV infection.\nHematopoietic cells isolated from transplanted mice revealed efficient gene editing (>95%), polyclonality of the T cell receptor repertoire, and neither signs of off-target effects nor leukemogenesis. Unc13d transcription levels of edited and wildtype cells were comparable.

Cell therapy has thus emerged as a possible means of filling this niche. Multiple cell types have now been tested both in the laboratory but also in the clinics and it is fair to acknowledge that none of the clinical trials have yet conclusively proven the efficacy of cell-based approaches. These clinical studies, however, have entailed the use of cells from various sources but of non-cardiac lineage origins. Although this might not be the main reason for their failures, the discovery of pluripotent stem cells capable of generating cardiomyocytes now raises the hope that such cardiac-committed cells could be therapeutically more effective. In this review, we will first describe where we currently are with regard to the clinical trials using PSC-differentiated cells and discuss the main issues which remain to be addressed. In parallel, because the capacity of cells to stably engraft in the recipient heart has increasingly been questioned, it has been hypothesized that a major mechanism of action could be the cell-triggered release of biomolecules that foster host-associated reparative pathways. Thus, in the second part of this review, we will discuss the rationale, clinically relevant advantages and pitfalls associated with the use of these PSC \"products\".",

Despite mesenchymal stromal cell transplantation having the potential to treat SAP, its clinical application prospect is limited, and the mechanism is unclear. Here, we reveal the therapeutic role of exosomes from TNF-\u03b1-preconditioned human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (HUCMSCs) in attenuating SAP and show that it is partly dependent on exosomal metabolites. Bioactive metabolomics analysis showed that 48 metabolites be significantly differentially expressed between the two groups (Exo-Ctrl group versus Exo-TNF-\u03b1 group). Then, the further functional experiments indicated that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol could be a key molecule mediating the therapeutic effect of TNF-\u03b1-preconditioned HUCMSCs. The animal experiments showed that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in the pancreatic tissue and inhibited acinar cell autophagy in a rat model of SAP. Mechanistically, we revealed that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol activated the mTOR pathway to inhibit acinar cell autophagy and alleviate SAP. In summary, our study demonstrated that exosomes from TNF-\u03b1-preconditioned HUMSCs inhibit the autophagy of acinar cells of SAP by shuttling 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol and inhibiting the mTOR pathway. This study revealed the vital role and therapeutic potential of metabolite-derived exosomes in SAP, providing a new promising method to prevent and therapy SAP.",

While the scientific community is working to develop vaccines and develop drugs against the COVID-19 pandemic, novel alternative therapies may reduce the mortality rate. Recently, the application of stem cells for critically ill COVID-19 patients in a small group of patients has been examined.\nWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to July 2022. Those studies that reviewed COVID-19 and cell therapy potentials were entered into the study. Moreover, some recently published patents were exploited and reviewed. Patentscope, USPTO, Espacenet, Free Patents Online, and Google Patents were used for patent searches.\nCell-based therapy as a modality of regenerative medicine is considered one of the most promising disciplines in the fields of modern science and medicine. Such an advanced technology offers endless possibilities for transformative and potentially curative treatments for some of the most life-threatening diseases. This therapeutic tool can be useful to reduce the rate of mortality. There have been several published patents for different stem cell therapy platforms in recent years.\nStem cell therapy could be considered a safe and effective therapeutic strategy to reduce death cases in patients infected with COVID-19. Besides, stem cell therapy might increase the pulmonary functions in the patients, it suppresses the occurring inflammations and ameliorates the symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurological disorder characterized by the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptides. The only medication used to treat moderate-to-severe AD progression is memantine. In this study, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated poly D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanostructures were prepared, as their self-assembling ability helps to penetrate the drug at disease sites with altered pH range (5.7-6.8) due to AD. Drug and polymer interaction studies by FTIR showed no interaction among them, and the thermal properties of drugs, polymers, and nanostructures tell us about their melting behaviour, thermal degradation, and glass transition temperatures. Characterization of prepared self-assembled nanoscaffolds signifies that the acquired properties such as size, structure, surface charges, zeta-potential, stability, thermal properties, biodegradability, biocompatibility, swelling ability, encapsulation, and drug loading provide an efficient therapeutic activity to the nanostructures for the treatment of AD. In addition, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) has revealed the paracellular transport mechanism of nanoscaffolds across the blood-brain barrier. ",

        "abstract": "Diosgenin, an essential dietary steroidal sapogenin, possess multiple pharmacological activities. This study aimed to assess the effects of diosgenin on periodontitis and elucidate the mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLCs) and a Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) plus ligation-induced animal model were used for in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. Inflammatory responses, nuclear factor \u03ba-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling and osteogenesis-related markers were measured both in LPS-stimulated hPDLSCs and in gingival tissue of periodontitis rats. Treatment with diosgenin significantly inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway in LPS-stimulated hPDLSCs. Further, treatment with diosgenin enhanced the expression of osteoblast-related genes and increased the osteogenic differentiation capacity. Further, activation NF-\u03baB pathway largely abolished the protective effects of diosgenin. Consistent with the in vitro studies, in vivo studies showed that administering diosgenin to periodontitis rats significantly lowered the levels of the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 and the inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB in gingival tissue. In addition, osteoblast-related genes were promoted. Diosgenin attenuates periodontitis by adjusting NF-\u03baB signaling to inhibit inflammatory effects and promoting osteogenesis, suggesting diosgenin might be developed as a therapeutic strategy for treating periodontitis in the future.",

        "title": "Joint models quantify associations between immune cell kinetics and allo-immunological events after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion.",
        "abstract": "Alloreactive donor-derived T-cells play a pivotal role in alloimmune responses after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT); both in the relapse-preventing Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL) effect and the potentially lethal complication Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD). The balance between GvL and GvHD can be shifted by removing T-cells via T-cell depletion (TCD) to reduce the risk of GvHD, and by introducing additional donor T-cells (donor lymphocyte infusions [DLI]) to boost the GvL effect. However, the association between T-cell kinetics and the occurrence of allo-immunological events has not been clearly demonstrated yet. Therefore, we investigated the complex associations between the T-cell kinetics and alloimmune responses in a cohort of 166 acute leukemia patients receiving alemtuzumab-based TCD alloSCT. Of these patients, 62 with an anticipated high risk of relapse were scheduled to receive a prophylactic DLI at 3 months after transplant. In this setting, we applied joint modelling which allowed us to better capture the complex interplay between DLI, T-cell kinetics, GvHD and relapse than traditional statistical methods. We demonstrate that DLI can induce detectable T-cell expansion, leading to an increase in total, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts starting at 3 months after alloSCT. CD4+ T-cells showed the strongest association with the development of alloimmune responses: higher CD4 counts increased the risk of GvHD (hazard ratio 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.45-4.12) and decreased the risk of relapse (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.92). Similar models showed that natural killer cells recovered rapidly after alloSCT and were associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR 0.62, 95%-CI 0.41-0.93). The results of this study advocate the use of joint models to further study immune cell kinetics in different settings.",

        "abstract": "Optimizing vaccine efficacy is of particular concern in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which mainly have an inadequate immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. This investigation aimed to explore the potential prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination strategies following autologous (auto-) HSCT.\nIn a randomized clinical trial, patients who had already received two primary doses of receptor-binding domain (RBD) tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during three to nine months after auto-HSCT were randomized to receive either a homologous RBD-TT conjugated or heterologous inactivated booster dose four weeks after the primary vaccination course. The primary outcome was comparing the anti-S IgG Immune status ratio (ISR) four weeks after the heterologous versus homologous booster dose. The assessment of safety and reactogenicity adverse events was considered as the secondary outcome.\nSixty-one auto-HSCT recipients were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either homologous or heterologous booster doses four weeks after the primary vaccination course. The mean ISR was 3.40 (95% CI: 2.63- 4.16) before the booster dose with a 90.0% seropositive rate. The ISR raised to 5.12 (95% CI: 4.15- 6.08) with a 100% seropositive rate after heterologous (P= 0.0064) and to 3.42 (95% CI: 2.67- 4.17) with a 93.0% seropositivity after the homologous booster doses (P= 0.96). In addition, the heterologous group suffered more AEs following the booster dosage than the homologous group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.955). In multivariable analysis, the prime-boost vaccination strategy (heterologous versus homologous), the level of ISR before the booster dose, and the length of time between auto-HSCT and booster dose were the positive predictors of serologic response to a booster dose. No serious adverse event is attributed to booster vaccination.\nIn patients who were primed with two SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses during the first year after auto-HSCT, heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination with inactivated platform resulted in considerably enhanced serologic response and non-significantly higher reactogenicity adverse events than homologous RBD-TT conjugated prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination strategy.",

Currently, high-intensity ultrasound has been widely used in clinical practice, while low-intensity ultrasound has gradually emerged as a new trend of transitioning from pre-clinical research to clinical applications. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), characterized by a non-invasive low-intensity pulse wave stimulation method, employs its non-thermal effects to achieve safe, economical, and convenient therapeutic outcomes. LIPUS converts into biochemical signals within cells through pathways such as cavitation, acoustic flow, and mechanical stimulation, regulating molecular biological mechanisms and exerting various biological effects. The molecular biology mechanisms underlying the application of LIPUS in obstetrics and gynecology mainly include signaling pathways, key gene expression, angiogenesis, inflammation inhibition, and stem cell differentiation. LIPUS plays a positive role in promoting soft tissue regeneration, bone regeneration, nerve regulation, and changes in cell membrane permeability. LIPUS can improve the treatment benefit of premature ovarian failure, pelvic floor dysfunction, nerve damage caused by intrauterine growth restriction, ovariectomized osteoporosis, and incomplete uterine involution through the above biological effects, and it also has application value in the adjuvant treatment of malignant tumors such as ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. This study outlines the biological mechanisms and applications of LIPUS in treating various obstetric and gynecologic diseases, aiming to promote its precise application and provide a theoretical basis for its use in the field.",

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disabling joint disease with no effective disease modifying drugs. Extracellular vesicles released by several types of mesenchymal stem cells could promote cartilage repair and ameliorate OA pathology in animal models, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-EVs) could maintain chondrocyte homeostasis and alleviate OA, and further revealed a novel molecular mechanism of this therapeutic effect. miR-223, which could directly bind with the 3'UTR of NLRP3 mRNA, was found to be a key miRNA for hUC-EVs to exert beneficial effects on inflammation inhibiting and cartilage protecting. For enhancing the effect on mitigating osteoarthritis, exogenous miR-223 was loaded into hUC-EVs by electroporation, and a collagen II-targeting peptide (WYRGRL) was modified onto the surface of hUC-EVs by genetic engineering to achieve a more targeted and efficient RNA delivery to the cartilage. The dual-engineered EVs showed a maximal effect on inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and chondrocyte pyroptosis, and offered excellent results for the treatment of OA. This study provides a novel theoretical basis and a promising therapeutic strategy for the application of engineered extracellular vesicles in OA treatment.",
